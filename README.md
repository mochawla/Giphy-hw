# Giphy

This application uses the Giphy API to call forth gifs on button click.

How it works: The application has a list of buttons with keywords displayed on them (in this case, keywords are names of basketball players). When one of these buttons is clicked, 10 gifs that match that keyword are shown to the user in still format. Clicking on the gifs allows you to play the gif.

Bootstrap was used for laying out the page.
